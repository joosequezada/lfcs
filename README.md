### II. Filesystem layout

FHSâ€¦ initiative to standardise filesystem organization in distributions

Pseudo-filesystems
Reside only in memory during runtime and not on disk. Contains nothing on a non-running system.

##### /bin
Essential binaries required when no other filesystems have yet been mounted. Also in single user mode or recover mode.

##### /sbin
System binaries during booting, recover or restore. Also capable of mounting /usr, /home etc.

##### /usr
A secondary hierarchy. /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/local, /usr/sbin
/usr/bin
Not needed for system booting. Contains multi-user applications. Package managers touch here.
/usr/share
Documentation (incl. man pages)
/usr/src
Kernel source

##### /boot
Contains compressed kernel image and initrd

##### /opt
Isolated installation directory (not scattered in multiple directories)
Helpful for proprietary sw or packages downloaded without package managers


##### /proc
Pseudo-fs. Persists only in memory for processes to keep internal state. Each process has its place as a subdirectory

##### /root
Home of root user

##### /var
For variable and volatile data that changes frequently. Logs, spool directories (for mail and cron), transient data for cache (e.g. packages) , lock files (linked to /run/lock)

##### /run
Pseudo-fs. For transient data that contains runtime information as lock files

### III. Processes

`orphan`: A process whose process has terminated. Its PPID is set to 1 that is, it's adopted by `init`.

`zombie`: A child process terminates without its parent gets notified of this. It still has an entry in the process table. 

`wait` is a system call that may be submitted by a process after forking a child process. Parent suspends execution and wait child process to complete and gets notified of its exit status.

PID is 16 bit integer located in /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max and can be altered.

##### Limits
`ulimit` gets/sets limits of the calling process. Limits on resources such as as max cpu time, max file locks, max open files, max threads, stack size, memory size, file size etc.

##### Permissions
A process can inherit permissions from 
* executor - the user who executes it
* executable - executable binary file, `setuid` bit set.

##### Execution modes
At any given time, a process is running in a certain execution mode.
* user mode: usually when executing application code
* kernel mode: when executing system calls to access hardware resources memory, disk, peripherals.

##### fork and exec
$ ls
bash process forks itself and a new copy, i.e. child process is created. fork() returns child's PID to parent. bash process goes into sleep state with `wait` system call on its child.
copy process makes `exec` system call and loads `ls` code in the child process space and executes it.
when execution completed, child process terminates via exit system call and returns exit code to kernel.
bash receives exit status either via polling or SIGCHLD signal handler from kernel, removes child's entry from process table (i.e. reaped) and it resumes execution.

state code |  Description
--- | --- 
D   | uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R   | running or runnable (on run queue)
S   | interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T   | stopped by job control signal (Ctrl+Z)
t   | stopped by debugger during the tracing
X   | dead (should never be seen)
Z   | defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

Kernel-created processes can run in
* kernel space for maintenance work
* user space - usually short lived

Their parent is kthreadd[2] and names are in encapsulated brackets.

##### Process priority
`nice` executes a command with adjusted niceness. The lower the niceness, the higher is the process priority.
$ nice -n +3 command args # increase niceness by 3, lowers priority by 3
`renice` to prioritize an existing process
$ renice -n -5 <pid>

##### Library types
static: An application compiled with a static library doesn't change thereafter even if static library is updated. .

shared: Such libraries can be loaded into application at runtime - also called dynamic link libraries (DLL). I think it can be thought as an external dependency that is satisfied from the environment and not during application build time. Shared libraries have \*.so extension.

`ldd` list shared dependencies of an executable.

### IV. Signals

A way of communication with a process (basic IPC)
It can originate from:
* _user_: via `kill` command
* _a process_: must be via system call through kernel
* _kernel_: e.g. a process makes an illegal memory reference

`kill` is the command to send signals to a process.

Signal handlers can be implemented in the program code or it can response according to the system defaults.

Signal | Default action | Description
--- | --- | ---
SIGHUP | Terminate | convention: for daemons, it reloads configuration file.
SIGINT | Terminate | interrupt from keyboard Ctrl-C
SIGFPE  | Core dump | sent from kernel to a process that attempts to divide by 0
SIGKILL | Terminate | abnormal termination (cannot be handled nor ignored)
SIGTERM | Terminate | graceful termination (default in `kill`) 
SIGSTOP | Stop | Cannot be handled nor ignored
SIGTSTP | Stop | Ctrl-Z
SIGCONT | Continue | Resume 
SIGCHLD | Ignore | Child stopped/terminated 
SIGPIPE | Terminate | Broken pipe; socket closed

`killall` sends signals to process(es) by name or user given.
`pkill` sends signals to processes by filtering by name or user.
`pgrep` is synopsis. Filters by name, owner, parent, time.
pgrep -u root java  # list java processes owned by root


### V. Package managers
In general, two families of package managers can be considered.

1. rpm... RedHat Package Manager
2. dpkg... Debian Package Manager

Packaging systems can be classified in two levels:
1. low-level: Low-level PMs deal with installation/removal only. They don't carry out dependency management. If a package is missing a dependency during installation, it will fail. Similarly, if a removal depends on some other package, it will also fail. 
* rpm in RedHat family
* dpkg in Debian family

2. high-level: High-level PMs are based on the low-level PMs. They handle dependency management, automatic dependency resolving and accesses external software repositories i.e. downloading/installing/removing of dependencies when needed.
* yum (RHEL, CentOS), dnf (Fedora) and zypper (SUSE) in RedHat family
* apt suite in Debian family


### VII. dpkg

dpkg database is located at /var/lib/dpkg/
dpkg is not aware of any repository. It knows, however, what is installed in the local system from dpkg database.

##### Package namings:

Binary package name:
<name>\_<version>-<revision>\_<architecture>.deb
e.g. logrotate\_3.7.8-1-\_amd64.deb
64 bit architecture called amd64.

Src package consists of:
* upstream src package \*.tar.gz (from package maintainer)
* metadata file \*.dsc describing the package
* second src package that contains patches to the upstream source \*.debian.tar.gz

##### Features

```bash
$ dpkg -l         # List installed packages
$ dpkg -c pkg.deb # List contents of \*.deb package
$ dpkg -L package # List files installed from a package
$ dpkg -S file    # Search what package installed <file> (bin, conf etc.)
$ dpkg -s package # Query status of an installed package
$ dpkg -I pkg.deb # Show info about \*.deb binary package 
```

```bash
$ dpkg -i pkg.deb ... # Install/update pkg.deb
$ dpkg -r pkg.deb ... # Remove/purge (-P)
```

### X. APT
APT software suite contains mainly apt-cache and apt-get which are based on dpkg.

##### Features

`apt-cache` queries packages from internal database (package index) at /var/lib/apt/lists.


```bash
$ apt-cache search term         # full text search on name and desc on all package lists
$ apt-cache show/showpkg pkg    # show information on pkg - exact name search 
$ apt-file search file          # search all packages that contains file
$ apt-file list pkg             # list all files in the pkg. pkg doesn't need to be installed or fetched
```

```bash
$ sudo apt-get autoremove       # uninstall not needed dependencies
$ sudo apt-get clean            # delete installed package archives from cache
```

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update       # sync package index lists with remote repos
$ sudo apt-get install pkg  # install/update pkg
$ sudo apt-get [--purge] remove pkg     # remove/purge pkg
$ sudo apt-get upgrade                  # apply all available updates to all pkgs 
```

### XI. System Monitoring

##### System logging

Important log files in `/var/log/`
--- | --- |
boot.log | system boot messages
dmesg   | kernel messages
syslog  | all important system messages
security  |  security logging

* /proc/ and /sys/ are pseudo-filesystems and contain information about the system state.

##### /proc/
* Current state of each process running: child processes, memory usage ...
* /proc/interrupts contain statistics on interrupts
- how many times an interrupt type was handled by which CPU?
* /proc/meminfo: meminfo 
* /proc/sys/ contain tunable system parameters in plain text files
- /proc/sys/kernel: kernel paramters
- /proc/sys/vm: virtual memory paramters

##### /sys/
aka sysfs. Provides unified information on device and drivers of various types, unified device model. Much of the hw information moved from /proc to /sys.
/dev vs /sys: /dev contains device files to access the devices themselves whereas /sys contains device information as powered on, vendor, model, bus etc.

##### SAR
System activity reporter for humans. Report is made up from the data that is collected by SADC in /var/log/sa periodically. Report can contain about
- IO, paging, network, per CPU, swap and memory, context switching etc.

$ sudo sar 3 3  # default report 3 times in 3 seconds

### XII. Process Monitoring

##### ps

```ps [pid]...```

`ps` grabs the information from /proc fs.

###### `ps` output table
column | description
--- | ---
vsz | virtual memory size in KB
rss | resident set size (physical mem size excl. swap)
cpu | cpu utilization
wchan | kernel function where process is sleeping
tty | attached terminal
pri | priority
ni | nice
comm | executable name only
args | command with all its args

###### `ps` options

```ps aux  # interpret options in BSD style grouped```
```ps -aux # interpret options in UNIX style grouped```

a: BSD style all processes
u: output in user-oriented format
x: remove "must have tty" restriction
-e: UNIX style all processes
-o : customize output like ps -o pid,uid,cmd
-l : long format

* `pstree` to visualize process hierarchy by pid or uid.
pstree [options] [pid,user]

### XIII. Memory Monitoring

Virtual memory consists of resident memory and swap area.

`/proc/sys/vm/` contains tunables for the virtual memory system.
entry | purpose
---   | ---
overcommit_memory | enable/disable overcommitting
overcommit_ratio | ?
oom_kill_allocating_task | let oom-killer kill the task that triggered

##### vmstat

```vmstat [options] [delay] [count]```
`vmstat` is the workhorse utility used mainly for memory stats but also for CPU, process and disk statistics.
-a option includes active and inactive memory namely pages recently used (might be clean or dirty) and pages not been recently used.
-d option is for disk statistics.

###### output columns

* procs
- r: # of processes in ready state
- b: # of processes in blocked state
* memory and io
- swpd: swap size being used
- free: current free memory
- buff: buff vs cache??
- cache: cache for data on disk for reads and also writes.
    * flush means write cache to disk.
- si: swap in v-mem read blocks/sec
- so: swap out v-mem written blocks/sec
- bi: blocks recvd from block device per sec
- bo: blocks sent to block device per sec
* system and cpu
- in: interrupts per sec
- cs: context switches per sec
- us: %CPU time spent running _user code_
- sy: %CPU time spent running _kernel code_
- id: %CPU time spent idle
- wa: %CPU time spent blocked in IO 
- st: %CPU time spent stolen from vm

###### Memory management

* Swap area is moved back to memory when enough memory is freed or priority becomes in swap becomes higher.

* To come out of the memory pressure, kernel overcommits memory (exceeds RAM + swap) by means of that many processes don't use all requested memory. This technique applies for user processes only.

* Overcommission is configured in `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` file.

* In case available memory is exhauseted, OOM-killer exterminates process(es) selected to free up memory. The hard part here is which process will be killed to keep the system alive. To avoid the whole system to crash, a victim process is selected to free up memory. Selection is based on the value `badness` that is at /proc/{id}/oom_score`.

```swapon/swappoff [devices...] # enable/disable devices for paging/swapping```

### XIV. IO Monitoring

In an I/O-bound system, the CPU is mostly idle waiting IO ops to complete such as disk or network ops.

##### `iostat`

```$ iostat [delay] [count]```

iostat is the workhorse utility for IO monitoring. It shows mainly RW transfer rates by disk partition including CPU utilization. The first report (row) is stats since the system boot.

###### output columns
Disk IO is expressed in number of blocks, the unit of work. Every read and write is done in multiple units of blocks.

* logical IO requests can be merged into one actual request

field | desc
---   | ---
device | disk device [or partition]
tps | io transactions per second
kB_read/s | blocks read per seconds in kB
kB_wrtn/s | blocks written per seconds in kB
kB_read | total block read in kB
kB_wrtn | total block written in kB

* -x option for extended output

##### iotop

* displays current IO usage by process updated periodically as in top.
* requires root access

* output columns

field | desc
---   | ---
SWAPIN | time percentage process blocked waiting swap in
IO | time percentage process blocked waiting io
PRIO | io priority

##### IO scheduling
* Every process is associated with an IO classifier and priority. `ionice` sets scheduling class/priority of a given process manually

```ionice [-c class] [-n pri] [-p pid] [cmd args]```

Apply io scheduling either for existing pid or by starting new process <cmd>
* IO scheduling class:
- 0: none
- 1: real time with a priority [0-7]
- 2: [default] best effort with a priority [0-7]
- 3: idle: served when there are no more requests

### XV. IO Scheduling
* VM and VFS submit IO requests and it's the job of IO scheduler to prioritize and order these requests before they are given to block devices.

* IO scheduling (sometimes conflicting) requirements:
- Minimize HW access:
    * requests ordered according to the physical location on disk: elevator scheme. SSDs don't require elevator scheme (rotational = 0)
    * requests are merged to get as big a contiguous region as possible
- Write operations can wait to migrate from caches to disk without stalling - async. Read ops are blocking until completed. Reads favored over writes
- Processes to share IO bandwidth fairly

* There are different IO scheduling strategies available
- Completely Fair Queueing (CFQ)
- Deadling scheduling
- noop

* IO scheduler strategy can be specified per device at __kernel boottime__ or at __runtime__
- to see available and current strategy, check `/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler`
- to switch the io scheduler
```echo noop > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler```

* IO scheduling tunables are at ```/sys/block/<device>/queue/iosched/``` directory. These parameters are based on the strategy and change from one strategy to another.

##### CFQ

* In CFQ, each process have its own request queue which works with a global dispatcher queue that submits actual requests to the device. Dequeuing each of these queues is done in round-robin style. Each queue is allocated timeslices to access the disk and works in FIFO order. Tunables:
- quantum: max len of dispatcher queue
- fifo_expire_async: expiry time of async request (buffered write) in queue. After it expires, it goes to dispatcher queue.
- back_seek_max: max distance for backwards seeking. repositioning the head backwards is bad performance.

##### Deadline

* Deadline strategy works based on the deadline - expiry of each request that guarantees to be served. There are 2 queues for r and w ordered by starting block (elevator queue), another 2 ordered by submission time (expire queue) and one global dispatcher queue. Scheduler checks expired requests first and only then moves to the elevator queue. Tunables:
- read_expire: deadline for r request
- write_expire: deadline for w request
- write_starved: reads are preffered to writes. how many w requests can be starved?
- fifo_batch: # of requests to move from sorted list to dispatcher when deadlines expired.
- front_merges: related with contiguous requests?

### XVI. Filesystems

Applications do not access the physical disk directly. Instead, application code access data contents by file names which is an abstraction by the filesystem.

Every file is associated with an inode. inode is a datastructures that holds following metadata about the file:
* permissions
* owner / owner group
* size
* timestamps (last accessed, modified, change)
To read a file content, you need to have inode number, first. File names are not stored in the file inodes but in the directory inode. Directory is a special file which holds a table that maps file names to inode ids. The name-inode mapping is called `link`.
```ln [-s] target link-name # creates a link```
* Hard link points to an inode. As a result, the same file can have multiple names mapped to the same inode.
* Soft link points to a filename

The entire filesystem tree doesn't need to be in one local disk partition. Some branches may be in another partition, network or removable media (usb etc.) Such branches are `mounted` to the filesystem tree.

##### Virtual file system
Application code doesn't change when accessing files in different disk partitions which might be using different filesystems. VFS is an abstraction layer that provides transparent data access from the underlying filesystem. This permits Linux to work with many filesystems:
* Linux native fs: ext4
* Windows native fs: fat32, vfat, ntfs
* Pseudo-fs: /proc, /sys, /dev
* Network fs; ntfs
* xfs: default fs in RHEL
`/proc/filesystem` holds the filesystem list suppored by the kernel.
`page` is smallest unit of data for virtual memory and a fixed-length contiguous block.

##### Special file systems
Kernel employs them for certain tasks, not available to user space.
Filesystem | Mount point | purpose
--- |   --- |  ---
rootfs  | none | 
proc    | /proc |
tmpfs   | Anywhere | file storage in RAM
sysfs   | /sys |

```df [file]... # disk space on all mounted filesystems```

### XVII. Disk partitioning

##### Common disk types
* SATA
* SCSI
* USB
* SSD

##### /dev/sd{order}{partition}
* `/dev/sd*` is disk device file which could be of type SCSI, SATA or USB. Following letter identifies the order, `/dev/sda` is the first device, `/dev/sdb` the second etc. The number refers to partition number, `/dev/sda2` is the second partition on `/dev/sda`.

`blkid` reports block device attributes.

`lsblk` lists block devices in a tree format.

`blkid` and `lsblk` work only with block devices.

##### Disk geometry
Rotational disks consist of platters, each of which is read by heads as disk spins. Tracks are divided into sectors in 512 byte size. SSDs are not rotational and have no moving parts.

##### Partitioning
Disk is divided into contiguous groups of sectors called partitions. Partitioning promotes:
* separation of user space from system space.
* easier backups
* performance and security enhancement on certain parts
* swap can be isolated
A partition is associated with
* type: primary, extended or logical
* start: start sector
* end: end sector
* filesystem

##### Partition table schemes
The content of hardware disk starts disk metadata, e.g. partition tables.
###### MBR
* Dates back to early days of MSDOS. In some tools, aka, _dos_ or _msdos_. Table is stored in the first 512 bytes of the disk. Up to 4 primary partitions of which one as an extended partition.
* Table has 4 entries and each 16 bytes size. Entry in the table contains active bit, file system code (xfs, ext4, swap etc.) and number of sectors.

![disk with MBR scheme](https://lms.quickstart.com/custom/799658/images/partition_table_small.png)

###### GPT
* modern. disk starts with the GPT header (and also proactive MBR for backwards compatibilit)
* Up to 128 entries (partitions) in the table and each 128 bytes of size.

![disk with GPT scheme](https://lms.quickstart.com/custom/799658/images/GPT%20Layout.png)

* The partition table comes with the vendor and it's possible to migrate it from MBR to GPT but it's not hard to brick the machine while doing so, thus, benefits are not worth the risk.

##### Backup partition tables

To backup MBR, copy MBR table
```sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=mbrbackup bs=512 count=1```

To restore MBR write it back to the disk
```sudo dd if=mbrbackupk of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1```

To backup GPT, use `sgdisk`
```sudo sgdisk --backup=sdabackup /dev/sda```

##### Partition table editors
Tools below at hardware device level. No filesystems need to be mounted ahead.

command | Desc
--- |   ---
fdisk  | most standard tool, works interactively for both MBR and GPT
sfdisk | non-interactive fdisk for scripting
parted | GNU partition manipulation
gparted| gui for parted
gdisk  | guid partition table manipulator
sgdisk | script interface for gdisk

To create a partition with `parted`
```sudo parted /dev/loop0 unit MB mkpart primary ext4 0 256```
You can specify partition file-system here or later with `mkfs`.

* /proc/partitions is what kernel is aware of partitions.

* ```losetup``` to associate a file or block device with a loop device. A loop device is pseudo device which makes a file to be accessed as a block device. Certain commands like `lsblk` work only with block devices.


### XVIII. Filesystem features

Extended attributes are metadata that filesystem does not handle directly. `lsattr` to list and `chattr` to change attributes.

Flags:
* a: append-only
* i: immutable
* d: skip dump
* A: set access time only when mod-time changes

Formatting a filesystem means creating a filesystem on a partition. `mkfs` utility exists for this.

```sudo mkfs -t [fs] [device-file]```
equivalent to ```sudo mkfs.ext4 [device-file]```

#### Checking/repairing filesystems
Check and fix filesystem error with ```fsck```. It should only run on unmounted systems.
```sudo fsck -t [fs] [device-file]```
equivalent to ```sudo fsck.ext4 [device-file]```

_journaling_ filesystems are much faster to check than older systems because not the whole filesystem needs to be checked only last failed transactions.

#### Mounting filesystem
n order to access a block device from the virtual filesystem, it first needs to be attached to the root directory tree at some point. You mount filesystems (on some device), not block devices directly. 

Question: Do I need to have a filesystem on a device before being able to mount it? Try and see.

```mount [target] [mount-point]``` and ```umount [mount-point]``` to unmount. Mount point directory needs to exist before. Non-empty directories can be used as mount points.
[target] can be either a device-file, a partition label or filesystem UUIDs. device-node can change at boot time (based on which device picked up first) and labels do not force unique names. UUIDs is reliable as it's unique to specify a device. Filesystem UUIDs are generated when creating (format) a filesystem.

Question: how can a filesystem UUID and device-file can be treated the same as a mount target. One is a block device and the other is a filesystem on it. That would also mean FS UUID is globally unique across all the hardware devices in the system. Based on the above, I think, you cannot mount a device without creating a filesystem on it, first.

```mount UUID=<fs-uuid> /mount-point```
```mount LABEL=<fs-label> /mount-point```

-t option for filesystem, optional `mount` can detect a filesystem.


```unmount [devicel-file | mount-point]```
If any terminal is open or any process is working in the mountpoint, unmount will fail with `target is busy error`.

#### Network shares
Mount remote filesystem with same `mount` command and work locally. The most common remote type is `Network File System (NFS)`.

```sudo mount -t nfs example.com:/home/karakays /mount```

#### Mounting at boot
```mount -a``` is used to mount all filesystems specified in `/etc/fstab`. Filesystems are mount as in their order in `fstab`. It contains space-separated values and also describes who may mount with what permissions. During boot time, `mount -a` is executed.
```<device, uuid, label> <mount-point> <type> <options in csv> <fsck pass or not>```

#### Automatic mount
You can let filesystems mount automatically when they are accessed. _systemd_ has built-in support for that using `/etc/fstab` file. This saves you extra mount commands.

```\# sample entry in /etc/fstab
LABEL=yubikey /mount ext4 noauto,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.device-timeout=10,x-systemd.idle-timeout=30```
noauto to disable auto mounting at boot. x-systemd.automount indicates systemd automount facility used.

### XIX. Filesystem features

#### Swap

* Most memory is used to cache file contents to prevent going to the disk more than necessary. _Such _pages_ are never swapper out_. _dirty pages_ (file content in memory != of in disk) are flushed out to disk.

* Memory use by Linux kernel never swapped out!

`mkswap device [size]` to set up a swap are in a device or _file_ given.
`swapon [device/file...]` to enable swapping on device given.
`swapoff [device/file...]` to disable swapping on device given.

#### Filesystem quotas
Disk quotas control maximum space particular users can have on the disk. It works on a mounted filesystem basis.

* To create quota, filesystem must be mounted with `usrquota` or `grpquota` options.

* `quotacheck` generates quota accounting files at root of quoted filesystem i.e. aquota.user, aquota.group

* `quotaon` and `quotaoff` to enable/disable quoting on a per filesystem basis.

* `quota` used to report on quotas. -u and -g options for current user/group. root can query any user's quota.

```sudo quota alice     # quora report of alice```

##### Setting up quotas
edquota is the quota editor to set it up. There are limits on blocks and on inodes. Limits are specified as soft and hard limits where hard limits can never be exceeded. Soft limits can be exceeded for a grace period. Grace periods are set per filesystem.

```edquota -u alice``` to edit limits of a user.

##### `df`
`disk free` lists all filesystems mounted, mountpoints and available space on each.
`disk usage` shows disk usage recursively starting from cwd. -s option to display a total for each argument without being recursive, -c to display grand total.

### XX. ext filesystems

`ext4` is default filesystem on most Linux distributions. Many enhancements achieved over ext2/3 such as, maximum filesystem size, maximum number of subdirectoeis, block allocation optimizations, faster fsck, more reliable journaling etc. Another improvement is using _extents_ for large files. ext3 used to hold a list of individual block pointers that a file allocates. That didn't scale well for large files, for a 1GB file, it needs 256K pointers (in 4K blocks). In ext4 instead, a group of contiguous blocks are used which are called _extents_.

* Block size is selected when filesystem is formatted, 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes. A block must fit into a memory page and because of that you cannot have 8K block in 4K pages.

* `inode reservation` is used to improve performance where a certain number of inodes are alocated ahead when directory is created.

#### ext4 layout
Disk blocks are grouped together into block groups. The first disk block 0 is reserved for partition boot sector?? and called boot block.  
The first and second blocks are same for every block group and comprise _superblock_ and _group descriptors_. Kernel uses first superblock (primary) and references other back superblock copies only during fsck until a healthy one is found.

![ext filesystem layout](/assets/ext_filesystem.png)

* superblock contains global information about the filesystem.
    - filesystem status to check during OS boot. If it's not cleanly unmounted, fsck is run before it gets mounted.
    - total mount count (reset in every `fsck`) and max mount count.
    - filesystem block size (set with `mkfs`)
    - disk blocks per block group
    - free block count
    - free inode count
    - OS id

* block and inode bitmaps contain 0s and 1s to indicate whether block/inode is free/used in the respective block group where they reside.

* inode table?

* `dumpe2fs` dumps ext file system information.
```dumpe2fs <device>

* `tune2fs` to tune ext filesystem parameters.

fragmentation: As new files get written and some deleted over the time, gaps are created in the disk. Sometimes, a new file doesn't quite fit in a gap so it needs to be split into parts and written into multiple areas in the disk. Reading a fragmented file is slow. Defragmentation tools enable to look for such files and restore them in contiguous blocks for faster reads.

### XXI. XFS and btrfs filesystems
Next generation filesystems with roboust capabilities challenge the dominance of `ext4` in Enterprise Linux distributions.

#### XFS
* Some of the features include handling of filesystems up to 16EB, of invidual files up to 8EB, Direct Memory Access IO, IO rate guarantee etc.

* As opposed to `ext4`, most of the maintenance tasks can be done online (while fs mounted): defragmentation, resize, dumping

#### btrfs
* Intended to address lack of some features like efficiency via COW technique, snapshots, pooling, checksums in `ext4`. It's the default fs in OpenSUSE.

* Revert to earlier snapshopts of the filesystem.
