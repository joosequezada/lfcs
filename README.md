### II. Filesystem layout

FHSâ€¦ initiative to standardise filesystem organization in distributions

Pseudo-filesystems
Reside only in memory during runtime and not on disk. Contains nothing on a non-running system.

##### /bin
Essential binaries required when no other filesystems have yet been mounted. Also in single user mode or recover mode.

##### /sbin
System binaries during booting, recover or restore. Also capable of mounting /usr, /home etc.

##### /usr
A secondary hierarchy. /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/local, /usr/sbin
/usr/bin
Not needed for system booting. Contains multi-user applications. Package managers touch here.
/usr/share
Documentation (incl. man pages)
/usr/src
Kernel source

##### /boot
Contains compressed kernel image and initrd

##### /opt
Isolated installation directory (not scattered in multiple directories)
Helpful for proprietary sw or packages downloaded without package managers


##### /proc
Pseudo-fs. Persists only in memory for processes to keep internal state. Each process has its place as a subdirectory

##### /root
Home of root user

##### /var
For variable and volatile data that changes frequently. Logs, spool directories (for mail and cron), transient data for cache (e.g. packages) , lock files (linked to /run/lock)

##### /run
Pseudo-fs. For transient data that contains runtime information as lock files

<a name="process here"></a>
### III. Processes

`orphan`: A process whose process has terminated. Its PPID is set to 1 that is, it's adopted by `init`.

`zombie`: A child process terminates without its parent gets notified of this. It still has an entry in the process table. 

`wait` is a system call that may be submitted by a process after forking a child process. Parent suspends execution and wait child process to complete and gets notified of its exit status.

PID is 16 bit integer located in /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max and can be altered.

##### Limits
`ulimit` gets/sets limits of the calling process. Limits on resources such as as max cpu time, max file locks, max open files, max threads, stack size, memory size, file size etc.

##### Permissions
A process can inherit permissions from 
* executor - the user who executes it
* executable - executable binary file, `setuid` bit set.

##### Execution modes
At any given time, a process is running in a certain execution mode.
* user mode: usually when executing application code
* kernel mode: when executing system calls to access hardware resources memory, disk, peripherals.

##### fork and exec
$ ls
bash process forks itself and a new copy, i.e. child process is created. fork() returns child's PID to parent. bash process goes into sleep state with `wait` system call on its child.
copy process makes `exec` system call and loads `ls` code in the child process space and executes it.
when execution completed, child process terminates via exit system call and returns exit code to kernel.
bash receives exit status either via polling or SIGCHLD signal handler from kernel, removes child's entry from process table (i.e. reaped) and it resumes execution.

state code |  Description
--- | --- 
D   | uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R   | running or runnable (on run queue)
S   | interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T   | stopped by job control signal (Ctrl+Z)
t   | stopped by debugger during the tracing
X   | dead (should never be seen)
Z   | defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

Kernel-created processes can run in
* kernel space for maintenance work
* user space - usually short lived

Their parent is kthreadd[2] and names are in encapsulated brackets.

##### Process priority
`nice` executes a command with adjusted niceness. The lower the niceness, the higher is the process priority.
$ nice -n +3 command args # increase niceness by 3, lowers priority by 3
`renice` to prioritize an existing process
$ renice -n -5 <pid>

##### Library types
static: An application compiled with a static library doesn't change thereafter even if static library is updated. .

shared: Such libraries can be loaded into application at runtime - also called dynamic link libraries (DLL). I think it can be thought as an external dependency that is satisfied from the environment and not during application build time. Shared libraries have \*.so extension.

`ldd` list shared dependencies of an executable.

### IV. Signals

A way of communication with a process (basic IPC)
It can originate from:
* _user_: via `kill` command
* _a process_: must be via system call through kernel
* _kernel_: e.g. a process makes an illegal memory reference

`kill` is the command to send signals to a process.

Signal handlers can be implemented in the program code or it can response according to the system defaults.

Signal | Default action | Description
--- | --- | ---
SIGHUP | Terminate | convention: for daemons, it reloads configuration file.
SIGINT | Terminate | interrupt from keyboard Ctrl-C
SIGFPE  | Core dump | sent from kernel to a process that attempts to divide by 0
SIGKILL | Terminate | abnormal termination (cannot be handled nor ignored)
SIGTERM | Terminate | graceful termination (default in `kill`) 
SIGSTOP | Stop | Cannot be handled nor ignored
SIGTSTP | Stop | Ctrl-Z
SIGCONT | Continue | Resume 
SIGCHLD | Ignore | Child stopped/terminated 
SIGPIPE | Terminate | Broken pipe; socket closed

`killall` sends signals to process(es) by name or user given.
`pkill` sends signals to processes by filtering by name or user.
`pgrep` is synopsis. Filters by name, owner, parent, time.
pgrep -u root java  # list java processes owned by root


### V. Package managers
In general, two families of package managers can be considered.

1. rpm... RedHat Package Manager
2. dpkg... Debian Package Manager

Packaging systems can be classified in two levels:
1. low-level: Low-level PMs deal with installation/removal only. They don't carry out dependency management. If a package is missing a dependency during installation, it will fail. Similarly, if a removal depends on some other package, it will also fail. 
* rpm in RedHat family
* dpkg in Debian family

2. high-level: High-level PMs are based on the low-level PMs. They handle dependency management, automatic dependency resolving and accesses external software repositories i.e. downloading/installing/removing of dependencies when needed.
* yum (RHEL, CentOS), dnf (Fedora) and zypper (SUSE) in RedHat family
* apt suite in Debian family


### VII. dpkg

dpkg database is located at /var/lib/dpkg/
dpkg is not aware of any repository. It knows, however, what is installed in the local system from dpkg database.

##### Package namings:

Binary package name:
<name>\_<version>-<revision>\_<architecture>.deb
e.g. logrotate\_3.7.8-1-\_amd64.deb
64 bit architecture called amd64.

Src package consists of:
* upstream src package \*.tar.gz (from package maintainer)
* metadata file \*.dsc describing the package
* second src package that contains patches to the upstream source \*.debian.tar.gz

##### Features

```bash
$ dpkg -l         # List installed packages
$ dpkg -c pkg.deb # List contents of \*.deb package
$ dpkg -L package # List files installed from a package
$ dpkg -S file    # Search what package installed <file> (bin, conf etc.)
$ dpkg -s package # Query status of an installed package
$ dpkg -I pkg.deb # Show info about \*.deb binary package 
```

```bash
$ dpkg -i pkg.deb ... # Install/update pkg.deb
$ dpkg -r pkg.deb ... # Remove/purge (-P)
```

### X. APT
APT software suite contains mainly apt-cache and apt-get which are based on dpkg.

##### Features

`apt-cache` queries packages from internal database (package index) at /var/lib/apt/lists.


```bash
$ apt-cache search term         # full text search on name and desc on all package lists
$ apt-cache show/showpkg pkg    # show information on pkg - exact name search 
$ apt-file search file          # search all packages that contains file
$ apt-file list pkg             # list all files in the pkg. pkg doesn't need to be installed or fetched
```

```bash
$ sudo apt-get autoremove       # uninstall not needed dependencies
$ sudo apt-get clean            # delete installed package archives from cache
```

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update       # sync package index lists with remote repos
$ sudo apt-get install pkg  # install/update pkg
$ sudo apt-get [--purge] remove pkg     # remove/purge pkg
$ sudo apt-get upgrade                  # apply all available updates to all pkgs 
```

### XI. System Monitoring

##### Monitoring tools

* process/load

--- | --- |
top, ps, pstree | processes
uptime | load
mpstat | multiprocessor usage
strace | system calls tracing

* memory/io

--- | --- |
free | brief memory usage
vmstat | detailed memory and block io usge
pmap | process memory map
iostat | cpu/io stats

* network

--- | --- |
netstat | 
iptraf | ?

##### System logging

Important log files in `/var/log/`
--- | --- |
boot.log | system boot messages
dmesg   | kernel messages
syslog  | all important system messages
security  |  security logging

* /proc/ and /sys/ are pseudo-filesystems and contain information about the system state.

##### /proc/
* Current state of each process running: child processes, memory usage ...
* /proc/interrupts contain statistics on interrupts
- how many times an interrupt type was handled by which CPU?
* /proc/meminfo: meminfo 
* /proc/sys/ contain tunable system parameters in plain text files
- /proc/sys/kernel: kernel paramters
- /proc/sys/vm: virtual memory paramters

##### /sys/
aka sysfs. Provides unified information on device and drivers of various types, unified device model. Much of the hw information moved from /proc to /sys.
/dev vs /sys: /dev contains device files to access the devices themselves whereas /sys contains device information as powered on, vendor, model, bus etc.

##### SAR
System activity reporter for humans. Report is made up from the data that is collected by SADC in /var/log/sa periodically. Report can contain about
- IO, paging, network, per CPU, swap and memory, context switching etc.

$ sudo sar 3 3  # default report 3 times in 3 seconds

### XII. Process Monitoring

##### ps

```ps [pid]...```

`ps` grabs the information from /proc fs.

###### `ps` output table
column | description
--- | ---
vsz | virtual memory size in KB
rss | resident set size (physical mem size excl. swap)
cpu | cpu utilization
wchan | kernel function where process is sleeping
tty | attached terminal
pri | priority
ni | nice
comm | executable name only
args | command with all its args

###### `ps` options

```ps aux  # interpret options in BSD style grouped```
```ps -aux # interpret options in UNIX style grouped```

a: BSD style all processes
u: output in user-oriented format
x: remove "must have tty" restriction
-e: UNIX style all processes
-o : customize output like ps -o pid,uid,cmd
-l : long format

* `pstree` to visualize process hierarchy by pid or uid.
pstree [options] [pid,user]

### XIII. Memory Monitoring

Virtual memory consists of resident memory and swap area.

`/proc/sys/vm/` contains tunables for the virtual memory system.
entry | purpose
---   | ---
overcommit_memory | enable/disable overcommitting
overcommit_ratio | ?
oom_kill_allocating_task | let oom-killer kill the task that triggered

##### vmstat

```vmstat [options] [delay] [count]```
`vmstat` is the workhorse utility used mainly for memory stats but also for CPU, process and disk statistics.
-a option includes active and inactive memory namely pages recently used (might be clean or dirty) and pages not been recently used.
-d option is for disk statistics.

###### output columns

* procs
- r: # of processes in ready state
- b: # of processes in blocked state
* memory and io
- swpd: swap size being used
- free: current free memory
- buff: buff vs cache??
- cache: cache for data on disk for reads and also writes.
    * flush means write cache to disk.
- si: swap in v-mem read blocks/sec
- so: swap out v-mem written blocks/sec
- bi: blocks recvd from block device per sec
- bo: blocks sent to block device per sec
* system and cpu
- in: interrupts per sec
- cs: context switches per sec
- us: %CPU time spent running _user code_
- sy: %CPU time spent running _kernel code_
- id: %CPU time spent idle
- wa: %CPU time spent blocked in IO 
- st: %CPU time spent stolen from vm

###### Memory management

* Swap area is moved back to memory when enough memory is freed or priority becomes in swap becomes higher.

* To come out of the memory pressure, kernel overcommits memory (exceeds RAM + swap) by means of that many processes don't use all requested memory. This technique applies for user processes only.

* Overcommission is configured in `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` file.

* In case available memory is exhauseted, OOM-killer exterminates process(es) selected to free up memory. The hard part here is which process will be killed to keep the system alive. To avoid the whole system to crash, a victim process is selected to free up memory. Selection is based on the value `badness` that is at /proc/{id}/oom_score`.

```swapon/swappoff [devices...] # enable/disable devices for paging/swapping```

### XIV. IO Monitoring

In an I/O-bound system, the CPU is mostly idle waiting IO ops to complete such as disk or network ops.

##### `iostat`

```$ iostat [delay] [count]```

iostat is the workhorse utility for IO monitoring. It shows mainly RW transfer rates by disk partition including CPU utilization. The first report (row) is stats since the system boot.

###### output columns
Disk IO is expressed in number of blocks, the unit of work. Every read and write is done in multiple units of blocks.

* logical IO requests can be merged into one actual request

field | desc
---   | ---
device | disk device [or partition]
tps | io transactions per second
kB_read/s | blocks read per seconds in kB
kB_wrtn/s | blocks written per seconds in kB
kB_read | total block read in kB
kB_wrtn | total block written in kB

* -x option for extended output

field | desc
---   | ---
rrqm/s | # of read requests merged per sec, queued to device
wrqm/s | # of write requests merged per sec, queued to device
r/s | # of read requests per sec, to the device
w/s | # of write requests per sec, to the device 
rkB/s | KB read per sec 
wkB/s | KB written per sec 
avgrq-sz | average request size in 512 bytes per sector
avgqu-sz | average queue length???
await | avg time elapsed in ms for queueing + servicing IO request
svctime | avg service time in ms for IO request
%util | ???

##### iotop

* displays current IO usage by process updated periodically as in top.
* requires root access

* output columns

field | desc
---   | ---
SWAPIN | time percentage process blocked waiting swap in
IO | time percentage process blocked waiting io
PRIO | io priority

##### IO scheduling
* Every process is associated with an IO classifier and priority. `ionice` sets scheduling class/priority of a given process manually

```ionice [-c class] [-n pri] [-p pid] [cmd args]```

Apply io scheduling either for existing pid or by starting new process <cmd>
* IO scheduling class:
- 0: none
- 1: real time with a priority [0-7]
- 2: [default] best effort with a priority [0-7]
- 3: idle: served when there are no more requests

### XV. IO Scheduling
* VM and VFS submit IO requests and it's the job of IO scheduler to prioritize and order these requests before they are given to block devices.

* IO scheduling (sometimes conflicting) requirements:
- Minimize HW access:
    * requests ordered according to the physical location on disk: elevator scheme. SSDs don't require elevator scheme (rotational = 0)
    * requests are merged to get as big a contiguous region as possible
- Write operations can wait to migrate from caches to disk without stalling - async. Read ops are blocking until completed. Reads favored over writes
- Processes to share IO bandwidth fairly

* There are different IO scheduling strategies available
- Completely Fair Queueing (CFQ)
- Deadling scheduling
- noop

* IO scheduler strategy can be specified per device at __kernel boottime__ or at __runtime__
- to see available and current strategy, check `/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler`
- to switch the io scheduler
```echo noop > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler```

* IO scheduling tunables are at ```/sys/block/<device>/queue/iosched/``` directory. These parameters are based on the strategy and change from one strategy to another.

##### CFQ

* In CFQ, each process have its own request queue which works with a global dispatcher queue that submits actual requests to the device. Dequeuing each of these queues is done in round-robin style. Each queue is allocated timeslices to access the disk and works in FIFO order. Tunables:
- quantum: max len of dispatcher queue
- fifo_expire_async: expiry time of async request (buffered write) in queue. After it expires, it goes to dispatcher queue.
- back_seek_max: max distance for backwards seeking. repositioning the head backwards is bad performance.

##### Deadline

* Deadline strategy works based on the deadline - expiry of each request that guarantees to be served. There are 2 queues for r and w ordered by starting block (elevator queue), another 2 ordered by submission time (expire queue) and one global dispatcher queue. Scheduler checks expired requests first and only then moves to the elevator queue. Tunables:
- read_expire: deadline for r request
- write_expire: deadline for w request
- write_starved: reads are preffered to writes. how many w requests can be starved?
- fifo_batch: # of requests to move from sorted list to dispatcher when deadlines expired.
- front_merges: related with contiguous requests?

### XVI. Filesystems

Applications do not access the physical disk directly. Instead, application code access data contents by file names which is an abstraction by the filesystem.

Every file is associated with an inode. inode is a datastructures that holds following metadata about the file:
* permissions
* owner / owner group
* size
* timestamps (last accessed, modified, change)
To read a file content, you need to have inode number, first. File names are not stored in the file inodes but in the directory inode. Directory is a special file which holds a table that maps file names to inode ids. The name-inode mapping is called `link`.
```ln [-s] target link-name # creates a link```
* Hard link points to an inode. As a result, the same file can have multiple names mapped to the same inode.
* Soft link points to a filename

The entire filesystem tree doesn't need to be in one local disk partition. Some branches may be in another partition, network or removable media (usb etc.) Such branches are `mounted` to the filesystem tree.

##### Virtual file system
Application code doesn't change when accessing files in different disk partitions which might be using different filesystems. VFS is an abstraction layer that provides transparent data access from the underlying filesystem. This permits Linux to work with many filesystems:
* Linux native fs: ext4
* Windows native fs: fat32, vfat, ntfs
* Pseudo-fs: /proc, /sys, /dev
* Network fs; ntfs
* xfs: default fs in RHEL
`/proc/filesystem` holds the filesystem list suppored by the kernel.
`page` is smallest unit of data for virtual memory and a fixed-length contiguous block.

##### Special file systems
Kernel employs them for certain tasks, not available to user space.
Filesystem | Mount point | purpose
--- |   --- |  ---
rootfs  | none | 
proc    | /proc |
tmpfs   | Anywhere | file storage in RAM
sysfs   | /sys |

```df [file]... # disk space on all mounted filesystems```

### XVII. Disk partitioning

##### Common disk types
* SATA
* SCSI
* USB
* SSD

##### Device naming scheme `/dev/sd{order}{partition}`
* `/dev/sd*` is the entire disk device file which could be of type SCSI, SATA or USB. Following letter identifies the order, `/dev/sda` is the first device, `/dev/sdb` the second etc. The number refers to partition number, `/dev/sda2` is the second partition on `/dev/sda`.

* SSD device naming scheme is `/dev/nvme{order}n{ns}p{part}`. {order} represents order, `/dev/nvme0n1` is the first entire disk device, `/dev/nvm1n1` the second etc. {ns} is the namespace and {part} is the partition number, e.g. `/dev/nvme0n1p1` represents device nvme0, with namespace 1 and partition 1.

`blkid` reports block device attributes.

`lsblk` lists block devices in a tree format.

`blkid` and `lsblk` work only with block devices.

##### Disk geometry
Rotational disks consist of platters, each of which is read by heads as disk spins. Tracks are divided into sectors in 512 byte size. SSDs are not rotational and have no moving parts.

##### Partitioning
Disk is divided into contiguous groups of sectors called partitions. Partitioning promotes:
* separation of user space from system space.
* easier backups
* performance and security enhancement on certain parts
* swap can be isolated
A partition is associated with
* type: primary, extended or logical
* start: start sector
* end: end sector
* filesystem

##### Partition table schemes
The content of hardware disk starts disk metadata, e.g. partition tables.
###### MBR
* Dates back to early days of MSDOS. In some tools, aka, _dos_ or _msdos_. Table is stored in the first 512 bytes of the disk. Up to 4 primary partitions of which one as an extended partition.
* Table has 4 entries and each 16 bytes size. Entry in the table contains active bit, file system code (xfs, ext4, swap etc.) and number of sectors.

![disk with MBR scheme](https://lms.quickstart.com/custom/799658/images/partition_table_small.png)

###### GPT
* modern. disk starts with the GPT header (and also proactive MBR for backwards compatibilit)
* Up to 128 entries (partitions) in the table and each 128 bytes of size.

![disk with GPT scheme](https://lms.quickstart.com/custom/799658/images/GPT%20Layout.png)

* The partition table comes with the vendor and it's possible to migrate it from MBR to GPT but it's not hard to brick the machine while doing so, thus, benefits are not worth the risk.

##### Backup partition tables

To backup MBR, copy MBR table
```sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=mbrbackup bs=512 count=1```

To restore MBR write it back to the disk
```sudo dd if=mbrbackupk of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1```

To backup GPT, use `sgdisk`
```sudo sgdisk --backup=sdabackup /dev/sda```

##### Partition table editors
Tools below at hardware device level. No filesystems need to be mounted ahead.

command | Desc
--- |   ---
fdisk  | most standard interactive tool, works for MBR and GPT
sfdisk | non-interactive fdisk for scripting
parted | GNU version, interactive tool, works for MBR and GPT
gparted| gui for parted
gdisk  | guid partition table manipulator
sgdisk | script interface for gdisk

##### fdisk
```fdisk -l         # list all partitions```
```fdisk <device>   # go to interactive mode for device```

##### parted
```parted <device> <command> <options>```

To create a partition with `parted`
```sudo parted /dev/loop0 unit MB mkpart primary ext4 0 256```
You can specify partition file-system here or later with `mkfs`.

* /proc/partitions is what kernel is aware of partitions.

* ```losetup``` to associate a file or block device with a loop device. A loop device is pseudo device which makes a file to be accessed as a block device. Certain commands like `lsblk` work only with block devices.

### XVIII. Filesystem features

Extended attributes are metadata that filesystem does not handle directly. `lsattr` to list and `chattr` to change attributes.

Flags:
* a: append-only
* i: immutable
* d: skip dump
* A: set access time only when mod-time changes

Formatting a filesystem means creating a filesystem on a partition. `mkfs` utility exists for this. Be careful, formatting a filesystem deletes existing content!

```sudo mkfs -t [fs] [device-file]```
equivalent to ```sudo mkfs.ext4 [device-file]```

#### Checking/repairing filesystems
Check and fix filesystem error with ```fsck```. It should only run on unmounted systems.
```sudo fsck -t [fs] [device-file]```
equivalent to ```sudo fsck.ext4 [device-file]```

_journaling_ filesystems are much faster to check than older systems because not the whole filesystem needs to be checked only last failed transactions.

#### Mounting filesystem
In order to access a block device from the virtual filesystem, it first needs to be attached to the root directory tree at some point. You mount filesystems (on some device), not block devices directly, so mounting is related with the filesystem rather then directly the disk device itself.

```mount [target] [mount-point]``` and ```umount [mount-point]``` to unmount. Mount point directory needs to exist before. Non-empty directories can be used as mount points.
[target] can be either a device-file, a partition label or filesystem UUIDs. device-node can change at boot time (based on which device picked up first) and labels do not force unique names. UUIDs is reliable as it's unique to specify a filesystem globally. Filesystem UUIDs are generated when creating (format) a filesystem. `blkid` can list device nodes and filesystem information on it without having it mounted first!

Question: how can a filesystem UUID and device-file can be treated the same as a mount target. One is a block device and the other is a filesystem on it. That would also mean FS UUID is globally unique across all the hardware devices in the system. Based on the above, I think, you cannot mount a device without creating a filesystem on it, first.

```mount UUID=<fs-uuid> /mount-point```
```mount LABEL=<fs-label> /mount-point```

-t option for filesystem, optional `mount` can detect a filesystem.

```unmount [devicel-file | mount-point]```
If any terminal is open or any process is working in the mountpoint, unmount will fail with `target is busy error`.

#### Network shares
Mount remote filesystem with same `mount` command and work locally. The most common remote type is `Network File System (NFS)`.

```sudo mount -t nfs example.com:/home/karakays /mount```

#### Mounting at boot
```mount -a``` is used to mount all filesystems specified in `/etc/fstab`. Filesystems are mount as in their order in `fstab`. It contains space-separated values and also describes who may mount with what permissions. During boot time, `mount -a` is executed.
```<device, uuid, label> <mount-point> <type> <options in csv> <fsck pass or not>```

#### Automatic mount
You can let filesystems mount automatically when they are accessed. _systemd_ has built-in support for that using `/etc/fstab` file. This saves you extra mount commands.

```\# sample entry in /etc/fstab
LABEL=yubikey /mount ext4 noauto,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.device-timeout=10,x-systemd.idle-timeout=30
```
noauto to disable auto mounting at boot. x-systemd.automount indicates systemd automount facility used. idle-timeout lets filesystem umount automaticaly after it stays idle timeout.

### XIX. Filesystem features

#### Swap

* Most memory is used to cache file contents to prevent going to the disk more than necessary. _Such _pages_ are never swapper out_. _dirty pages_ (file content in memory != of in disk) are flushed out to disk.

* Memory use by Linux kernel never swapped out!

`mkswap device [size]` to set up a swap are in a device or _file_ given.
`swapon [device/file...]` to enable swapping on device given.
`swapoff [device/file...]` to disable swapping on device given.

#### Filesystem quotas
Disk quotas control maximum space particular users can have on the disk. It works on a mounted filesystem basis.

* To create quota, filesystem must be mounted with `usrquota` or `grpquota` options.

* `quotacheck` generates quota accounting files at root of quoted filesystem i.e. aquota.user, aquota.group

* `quotaon` and `quotaoff` to enable/disable quoting on a per filesystem basis.

* `quota` used to report on quotas. -u and -g options for current user/group. root can query any user's quota.

```sudo quota alice     # quora report of alice```

##### Setting up quotas
edquota is the quota editor to set it up. There are limits on blocks and on inodes. Limits are specified as soft and hard limits where hard limits can never be exceeded. Soft limits can be exceeded for a grace period. Grace periods are set per filesystem.

```edquota -u alice``` to edit limits of a user.

##### `df`
`disk free` lists all filesystems mounted, mountpoints and available space on each.
`disk usage` shows disk usage recursively starting from cwd. -s option to display a total for each argument without being recursive, -c to display grand total.

### XX. ext filesystems

`ext4` is default filesystem on most Linux distributions. Many enhancements achieved over ext2/3 such as, maximum filesystem size, maximum number of subdirectoeis, block allocation optimizations, faster fsck, more reliable journaling etc. Another improvement is using _extents_ for large files. ext3 used to hold a list of individual block pointers that a file allocates. That didn't scale well for large files, for a 1GB file, it needs 256K pointers (in 4K blocks). In ext4 instead, a group of contiguous blocks are used which are called _extents_.

* Block size is selected when filesystem is formatted, 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes. A block must fit into a memory page and because of that you cannot have 8K block in 4K pages.

* `inode reservation` is used to improve performance where a certain number of inodes are alocated ahead when directory is created.

#### ext4 layout
Disk blocks are grouped together into block groups. The first disk block 0 is reserved for partition boot sector?? and called boot block.  
The first and second blocks are same for every block group and comprise _superblock_ and _group descriptors_. Kernel uses first superblock (primary) and references other back superblock copies only during fsck until a healthy one is found.

![ext filesystem layout](/assets/ext_filesystem.png)

* superblock contains global information about the filesystem.
    - filesystem status to check during OS boot. If it's not cleanly unmounted, fsck is run before it gets mounted.
    - total mount count (reset in every `fsck`) and max mount count.
    - filesystem block size (set with `mkfs`)
    - disk blocks per block group
    - free block count
    - free inode count
    - OS id

* block and inode bitmaps contain 0s and 1s to indicate whether block/inode is free/used in the respective block group where they reside.

* inode table?

* `dumpe2fs` dumps ext file system information.
```dumpe2fs <device>```

* `tune2fs` to tune ext filesystem parameters.

fragmentation: As new files get written and some deleted over the time, gaps are created in the disk. Sometimes, a new file doesn't quite fit in a gap so it needs to be split into parts and written into multiple areas in the disk. Reading a fragmented file is slow. Defragmentation tools enable to look for such files and restore them in contiguous blocks for faster reads.

### XXI. XFS and btrfs filesystems
Next generation filesystems with roboust capabilities challenge the dominance of `ext4` in Enterprise Linux distributions.

#### XFS
* Some of the features include handling of filesystems up to 16EB, of invidual files up to 8EB, Direct Memory Access IO, IO rate guarantee etc.

* As opposed to `ext4`, most of the maintenance tasks can be done online (while fs mounted): defragmentation, resize, dumping

#### btrfs
* Intended to address lack of some features like efficiency via COW technique, snapshots, pooling, checksums in `ext4`. It's the default fs in OpenSUSE.

* Revert to earlier snapshopts of the filesystem.

### XXII. Encrypting disks

Encryption at the block device level provides strong protection. Linux Unified Key Setup is the standard method in Linux that provides this facility. LUKE is installed on top of `cryptsetup` utility.

##### cryptsetup
`cryptsetup` is to manage LUKS encrypted partitions.
```cryptsetup [options...] <action> <action args>```

Format the partition with LUKS and sets a symmetric secret. This is done only once.
```sudo cryptosetup luksFormat /dev/sda2```
Make partition unencrypt and available to use, asks for secret interactively.
luksOpen creates a mapping from which the partition will be available. The device will be located at /dev/mapper/name.
```sudo cryptosetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 name```
From now on, use the device as if it were unencrypted partition.
Format filesystem first and mount
```sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/name``` 
```sudo mount /dev/mapper/name /mnt``` 
When done, unmount it and remove the mapping with luksClose.
```sudo umount /dev/mapper/name``` 
```sudo cryptsetup lukeClose /dev/mapper/name```

##### Mounting at boot
To mount an encrypted partition at boot time, add a normal entry to /etc/fstab. /etc/fstab is not aware that device is encrypted.
/dev/mapper/name /mnt ext4 defaults 0 0
Add entry to /etc/crypttab to specify mapping. <target> is mapped device name, source is actual block device which can be device file, uuid or label. If <key-file> is omitted, secret will be asked from the console.
<target> <source> [<key-file>]
name /dev/sda

Swap partitions can be encrypted, too.

### XXIII. LVM

Logical Volume Management is about grouping physical partitions together from one or more devices into a big logical volume group. This volume pool is subdivided into logical volumes of which each mimics a physical disk partition to the system. A filesystem is places in a logical volume and ultimately, volume gets mounted to be accessible.

Advantages:
    * Room for parallelization improvements with data striping (spreading out a filesystem to more than one disk, i.e. a logical volume spread to more one disk)
    * Logical volumes can be easily resized even if it already contains a filesystem.

[](https://lms.quickstart.com/custom/799658/images/LVM_Components_large%20(1).png)

#####  Manage _physical volumes_ via pv* tools
`pvcreate`: Convert a partition to physical volume. Refer to a physical partitition directly.
    ```pvcreate /dev/sda7```
`pvdisplay`: List physical volumes
`pvmove`: Moves data from one physical volume to the others
`pvremove`: Removes physical volume

##### Manage _volume groups_ via vg* tools
`vgcreate`: Create volume group. Refer to a physical volumes to include. Creates /dev/myvg device file.
    ```vgcreate myvg /dev/sda7```
`vgextend`: Extend volume group. Refer to a physical volumes when extending
    ```vgextend <pv2>```
`vgreduce`: Shrinks volume group

##### Manage _logical volumes_ via lv* tools
`lvcreate`: Create a logical volume in `/dev/myvg/mylv`
    ```lvcreate -L 50G -n mylv vg```
    ```mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylv```
`lvdisplay`: list logical volumes

Steps in creating a logical volume

1. Create physical volumes from partitions, 1-to-1 mapping
2. Create a volume group by including physical volumes 
3. Extend volume group with extra physical volumes if need be
3. Create logical volumes within the group. Specify the size in bytes or number of extents (size unit in a volume group, by default 4MB). That means a logical volume do not reference any physical partition or disk, which, I suppose, explains how a logical volume can be spread into multiple physical partitions.
4. Format a logical volume via mkfs
5. Mount the logical volume

##### Resizing a logical volume
Resizing can be done even if lv contains a filesystem.
* lvextend
* lvreduce
* resize2fs
* lvresize

To expand a lv, volume, first, needs expanded, then the filesystem.
```lvextend -L +500M /dev/vg/mylvm```
```resize2fs /dev/vg/mylvm```

To shrink a volume, first shrink the filesystem then the volume.
```resize2fs /dev/vg/mylvm 200M```
```lvreduce -L -200MB /dev/vg/mylvm```

`-r` option in `lvresize` command does this automatically by resizing both the volume and filesystem.
```lvresize -r -L 20 GB /dev/VG/mylvm```

#### LVM snapshots
A snapshot of an existing logical volume is useful for backup, app testing or deployin VMs etc.
* When original lv changes, original data blocks are copied to the snapshot??
* But if data is added to the snapshot, it's only stored there

### XXIV. RAID

Redundant Array of Independant Disks is clustering of physical disks to enable data integrity and recoverability. Disk IO activity is spread into the cluster. Data striping provides parallel writes that increases performance.
RAID can be implemented either in software or in hardware. Linux kernel supports software RAID. `mdadm` is the tool to create and manage software RAID devices.

On the other hand, hardware RAID are transparent to OS.
Features:
* mirroring - storage clustering for availability
* striping - splitting filesystems to more than one disk
* parity - fault tolerant with extra data for error recovery

#### RAID levels
Raid levels increas by complexity.

* RAID 0: striping only
* RAID 1: mirroring only
* RAID 5: striping and fault-tolerant up to 1 disk loss. Requires at least 3 disks.
* RAID 6: striping and fault-tolerant with dual parity up to 2 disk loss. Requires at least 4 disks.
* RAID10: mirroring and strping.

Create a software raid device
```mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-disks=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1```

#### Hot spare
A hot spare is used as a failover mechanism. It is active in the cluster and is switched into operation when a disk fails. A hot spare can be created when creating RAID array or later on via the `mdadm`.

### XXV. Kernel services and configuration

Linux is the kernel and includes libraries and applications that interact with the system. It manages system resources such as CPU, memory and disk. Kernel makes other periphereal devices available through device drivers.

#### kernel command line

Parameters can be passed to kernel when it boots with kernel command which looks like

```linux /boot/vmlinuz-4-19.0 root=<uuid> ro quiet```

Kernal command line is found in `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` and is here to pass start up options. Any options not understood are are passed to `init`. Available options can be found in `man bootparam`.

* root = root filesystem
* ro  = mount root read-only
* quiet = less verbose logging
* LANG = system language

#### `sysctl`
`sysctl` is to tune kernel and also system parameters at runtime. Parameters are in key = value format. To list all parameters

`sysctl -a`
kernel.pid_max = 111
net.ipv4.forward = 1
net/ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=0
vm.swapiness = 30

To get one parameter,
`sysctl kernel.pid_max`

Each key corresponds to a `pseudofile under` `/proc/sys/key` and parameter value is the file content, e.g. `kernel.pid_max` value can be found in file `/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max`.
To set a parameter, either write to corresponding file or

`sudo sysctl net.ipv4.forward=1`

`/etc/sysctl.conf` contains parameters that are read and set during boot. To apply current configuration, simply modify some variables if need be and apply

`sudo sysctl -p`

### XXX. User account management

```/etc/passwd` is the local user directory. Users are defined in `/etc/passwd`and each account has its own entry in `/etc/passwd` that holds basic user attributes like

* username, uid, gid
* home, default shell
Each field is separated with a colon.

```karakays:x:1000:1000:Selcuk Karakayali,,,:/home/karakays:/bin/bash```

#### `/etc/shadow`
Password field contains hashed password. It's left with `x` if passwords are managed with `/etc/shadow`.  
```/etc/passwd``` has `644` permissions that means anyone can read it. This is because system programs and user apps need to read the information in that file. On the other hand, `/etc/shadow` has `400` permissions. `/etc/shadow``` is preferred way to keep passwords as it prevents anyone to read hashed passwords.

`/etc/shadow` contains one entry line for each user and contains password-related attributes with colon separated fields

```acme:$6$WWFDxsbs$7tFoaoCdErof8VyvHF9vO9kMAIeHk9FTc790VDZpUevYTh4/hcA/IvX.YGkZJU/Qm0:18100:0:99999:7:::```

Fields (for details, see ```man shadow```)

* username
* hashed password: `$6$` followed by 8 chars salt, followed by `$` and sha512'ed password
 - `!` in front or solely `!!` means account is locked
* lastchange of passwd
* minimum and maximum passwd age
* password warning and inactivity period
* account expiration date - default=empty, no expiry
* reserved

When a new user is created, by default, it won't have a password yet. This is indicated wiath `!` alone in the shadow file. passwd` is to create a password for a user. `root` can change any password. To change `dexter`'s passowrd,

```sudo passwd dexter```

##### `chage` password aging
`chage` is used to edit password aging attributes in shadow. Only root can change these attributes.

##### Creating/deleting/editing user accounts

Create new user account for username dexter

```sudo useradd dexter```

whereas with following defaults for new user. By default, it doesn't get a password for the user so user cannot login at all. Defaults specified in `/etc/default/useradd` and they are

* next available uid assigned to dexter. By convention, any account id less than `1000` is considered special and is a system account.
* a group `dexter` created where gid=uid and assigned as primary group
* home directory is _not_ created
* `/bin/sh` set as default shell
* `/etc/skel` contents copied to home as default dotfiles

Any attribute can be overridden with options to the `useradd` command.

```sudo useradd -m -c 'Dexter Dog' -s /bin/bash dexter```

System-wide login configurations are hold in `/etc/login.defs`.

Remove a user and all its references in `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group` etc.

```sudo userdel dexter```

`/home/dexter` is kept by default.

Edit user attributes with using the options to `usermod` command. To lock the user account

```sudo usermod -L dexter```

or

```sudo passwd -l dexter```

Locking an account means that it prevents password authentication in login. However, same user can login with other authentication mechanisms, e.g. ssh keys.

Locking password in ways above puts a `!` in front of the passwd field. Unlocking removes the `!`. Another way to lock an account is replace hashed password with `!!`.

Unlocking is done with `-U` or `-u` option, respectively.

#### Check: disabled accounts vs locked accounts.

##### System accounts

System accounts should be locked. `-r` option creates one with no aging information in shadow file.

```sudo useradd -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin tomcat```

They can only run programs. Default shell should be set to `/sbin/nologin` or `/usr/sbin/nologin` which prevents account to login. User is prompted with ```This account is currently is not available.``` message if it attempts to login.

```bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin```

#### Restricted account

A restriced shell is a tightly controlled shell. It can be invoked with `r` option.

`bash -r`

It prevents a user to

* cd directories
* changing certain env variables
* specify an absolute path in any command
* io redirecting

A restricted account is set to use restricted shell `/bin/rbash` in `/etc/passwd` whereas `/bin/rbash` is a symlink to `/bin/bash`. This is a workaround as flags may not be specified in `/etc/passwd`.

##### root account

`root` account should only be used when absolutely necessary and never be used as a regular account. `sudo` makes an audit trail of any root access. It should be prohibited to login directly to root account.

#### SSH

Configurations

file        | purpose
---         | ---
id_rsa.pub  | default public key
id_rsa      | default private ky
authorized_keys | list of identities who can login in this host
known_hosts | trusted hosts (public keys)
config  | ssh client config

`ssh-keygen` is to generate identity keys.

#### Remote graphical login

VNC (virtual network computing) is to login remotely with full graphical desktop. `tigervnc` is an implementation.

### XXXI. Group management

Groups are defined in `/etc/group`. It contains group name, group password, gid and comma-separated list of users.

```groupname:passwd:GID:user1,user2,...```

Group identifiers between 0 and 99 are reserved for system groups. Values between 100 and `GID_MIN` are for special. A user is not listed in the members if this is its primary group.

Groups are managed with following tools. They basically modify `/etc/groups`

* groupadd
* groupdel
* groupmod

To modify groups of `dexter`, use the following

```usermod -G staff,group1,group2 dexter```

To set user's primary group when creating a new user

```useradd -g primary-group dexter```

#### User Private Groups

A user private group, UPG, is a group where

* GID = UID, group name = user name
* UPG is set as the user's primary group  

By default, `useradd` creates a UPG for the new user.

#### Memberships

Every user has one primary group, however it also belong from 0 to 15 secondary groups. To list the groups `dexter` belongs to 

```groups dexter```

### XXXII. File permissions

Any request to kernel to access a file requires authorization - whether calling user has file permission for that action. File permissions are checked in the following order
1. owner
2. if not owner, check group
3. otherwise, others

#### chmod

Multiple permissions can be specified separated with comma

```chmod ug+w,o+r somefile```

Setting permissions with octal digits require to set whole permissions. In contrast to this, symbolic form lets you specify only what's needs to be changed, not more.

How permissions work for a directory?

* `r` bit needed to access directory
* `x` bit needed to list directory contents. otherwise, each content item shown with `?` marks.
* `rx` bits neded to properly list the directory - first access and then list
* 'wx" bits neded to create a file in the directory

#### umask

Default permissions at kernel level for newly files are

* 0666 for file
* 0777 for directories

`umask` is a global permission mask that is applied to newly created files and directories. That means, actual permissions are made up by combining these defaults with the umask value. More precisely, umask's XORed value is ANDed with default permissions. To get current umask value,

```$ umask```
```0002```

or to get it in symbolic form

```$ umask -S```
```u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx```

```0666 & ~0002 = 0664```

to set the umask,

```umask 0022```

#### Filesystem ACLs

Filesystem permissions can be controlled in a more fine-grained way with ACL than simple users, groups.  Major filesystems support ACL extensions and to enable it, one can use the `acl` option when mounting. To see ACLs of a file

```getfacl file```

To give read and write permission to dexter via ACLs

```setfacl -m u:dexter:rw file```

To remove ACLs for rocky on file

```setfacl -x u:rocky file```

### XXXIII. PAM

Pluggable Authentication Modules provides authentication policies in a uniformed and modular way for various applications. Historically, applications such as ssh, su, login did authentication management independently of each other.  

#### PAM configuration
PAM configuration files are found in `/etc/pam.d`. Each file corresponds to a service that relies on PAM for authentication, e.g.
* sudo
* su
* login
* passwd
* sshd
* reboot etc.

A PAM-aware application invokes `libpam` which in turn checks these configuration files to apply rules and might invoke further modules.

Each line in a PAM configuration specifies a rule that is made of

`type` `control` `module-path` `module-args`

Modules are stacked together and all together they build up the authentication process. Modules are executed in the order and the result of each module (either success or failure) affects overall authentication.

##### type or module interface
Specifies the module interface to be used

type | desc
--- | ---
`auth` | Instruct the app to authenticate the user
`account`  | Checks users account attributes such as if account has expired or authn allowed at that time
`password` | Used for changing passwords
`session` | functions before and after session is established

##### control
Controls how success of failure of current module in the stacks affects overall process

control | desc
---         | ---
`required` | Module must pass but on failure it doesn't fail immediately and other modules continued
`requisite` | same as `required` but failes immediately on failure and terminates authentication
`optional` | module not required
`sufficient` | if module succeeds, not subsequent modules in the stack executed

##### module-path and module args
path of the library (*.so file) to invoke and with its arguments

#### LDAP

PAM can be configured to work with an LDAP server. LDAP provides a centralized identity directory over the network.

### XXXIV. Network addresses

#### IPv4
* IPv4 is of 4 bytes where IPv6 is of 16 bytes.

* A IPv4 address consists of a network portion and a host portion. Bother together identifies a host's network and address in the network. `netmask` is used to determine how much of the address belongs to network portion and host portion.

- unicast: associated with a specific host
- network: host portion is set to 0, e.g. x.x.x.0
- broadcast: host portion is set to 1, e.g. x.x.x.1
- multicast: only nodes that are appropriately configured will listen to a multicast.

Reserved addresses:
- 0.0.0.0 denotes unknown address of the host. DHCP uses this address when communicating to server.

IPv4 address classes:

class |  most significant octet range | network portion in bits | netmask
--- | ---                             | ---                     | ---
A   | 1-127                           | 8                       | x.0.0.0
B   | 128-191                         | 16                      | x.x.0.0
C   | 192-223                         | 24                      | x.x.x.0
D   | 224-239                         | na                      | na
E   | 240-254                         | na                      | na

network address = unicast & netmask

#### Hostname
* In DNS, hostnames are appended with a dot and domain name to qualify FQDN, e.g. debian.karakays.com

* hostname is kept at `/etc/hostname`. `hostname` command displays it.

### XXXV. Network devs and configuration

Network devices are not associated with a device file, they are known by names as
* eth0, eth1  for ethernet devices
* wlan0, wlan1, wlp3s0, wlp3s1 for wireless devices

#### `ip`
`ip` is a multiplex tool that is used to configure, control and query network devices or interface parameters. It's preferred tool over the deprecated `ifconfig`.

```ip [ options] object <command>``` where object can be

object      | function
---         | ---
address     | IPv4 or v6 address
link        | network devices (interface)
route       | routing table entries
monitor     | watch for netlink messages

```ip addr show wlp3s0```  # show address of interface
```ip link show            # list network devices```
```ip link set eth0 down   # bring eth0 down```

#### PNIDN
Traditional network device naming scheme is unpredictable. One network device name can be assigned to another device in the next boot. To solve that, `Predictable Network Interface Device Names` is introduced which incorportes more device details when assigning names to network interfaces
* Firmware or BIOS provided index numbers, e.g. eno1
* Firmware or BIOS provided PCI Express hotplug slot index numbers, e.g. ens1
* Physical/geographical location of hw connection, e.g. enp2s0
* MAC address, e.g. enx7837d1ea46da
* old classic method, e.g. eth0

#### NIC
Network configurations applied by `ip` or `ifconfig` tools  are _non-persistent_, in other words, this configuration is lost after reboot. To make it persistent, network interface configuration files, NIC, need to be used of which format depends on distro
* RedHat: /etc/sysconfig/network
* Debian: /etc/network/interfaces
* SUSE: /etc/sysconfig/network

#### Network Manager
`Network Manager` is a `systemd` service that manages network configurations. It generates the ultimate NIC file and by doing so it saves manual editing of NIC files. It is also used to list wireless networks in range, enter network passwords, turn devices on/off etc. It comes in several client interfaces.

* GUI offered by Desktop Environment. 
* nmtui: text user interface (on terminal) for network manager.
* nmcli: CLI for network manager.

nmtui and nmcli are distro independent and abstract differences in NICs.

```nmcli device wifi list                                   # list wifi networks in range```  
```nmcli device wifi connect <ssid>                         # connect to network```  
```nmcli connection show                                    # list connection profiles```  
```nmcli connection show <ssid>                             # show details of ssid```  
```nmcli con modify <ssid> +ipv4.addreses 192.168.1.10      # configure static IP```

#### Routing
For every TCP/IP packet being transmitted, network interfaces, sometimes, cannot transmit packets directly to the destination and need to forward to intermediate routers. A routing table is here to help find the next stop of a packet. This is done by comparing routing entries in the table with the final destination address of the packet. Packet is forwarded to the gateway address of the routing entry found, Some routing entries might not have a gateway which is indicated with the absence of `G` flag. To see current routing table

```$ ip route show```

A typical routing entry contains

Column  | Desc
---     | ---
destination | destination network address
gateway | address of the router to forward datagram to
genmask | destination network mask
iface   | network device to send datagram through 
flag    | e.g. U for up, G for network has gateway
metric  | priority in case multiple matches are found

##### Default route
Fallback route chosen in case destination address doesn't match any entry in the routing table. 
It can be obtained dynamically using DHCP or configured manually via `nmcli` or editing NIC. To set it in the NIC file, `gateway` keywork is used in the configuration.

##### Static routes
Static routing entries can be added to the table via `ip` command. By default, local network address is setup as a static route so that peer to peer requests can be made in the LAN without involving the default gateway.

```sudo ip route add <args>```

#### DNS

* `/etc/hosts` is the place for static name resolutions, a local host database. If a name resolution cannot be done here, a DNS resolver gets queried whose addresses are at `/etc/resolv.conf`. NetworkManager can edit this file invoking DHCP on the primary network interface.

* `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` contain access control rules for TCP wrappers. A rule is related to clients (based on ip or domain name) can access what service (sshd, ftpd, etc.) on the system.

##### Diagnostic tools

`traceroute` traces the path of a request along its way to the final destination. It shows how router packets flow.
`mtr` combines `ping` and `traceroute` commands. It constantly sends requests and continuously updates trace display like `top`.

### XXXVI. Firewalls
Firewalls are  based on packet filtering for both incoming and outgoing network traffic. It applies a set of rules to each packet and consequently, a packet is accepted, rejected, altered or redirected etc. Common tools are

* `iptables` complex tool to configure firewall rules.
* `ufw` (uncomplicated firewall) is a front-end for `iptables` to assist and comes with Ubuntu.
* `firewalld` is another front-end for `iptables` to assist.

#### firewalld
`firewalld` is the modern firewall service and replaces `iptables`.

#### Zones

A `zone` defines a level of trust and a known profile applied for incoming/outgoing traffic. Each network interface belongs to a zone. Rules can be applied in runtime or in a permanent way. Some of the zones are

* drop; incoming dropped without a reply. only outgoing permitted.
* block: incoming rejected
* public: don't trust any host, only selected connections allowed. _default_ zone on all interfaces.
* external
* dmz: some services are allowed to be used publicly. particular incoming allowed.
* work
* home
* internal
* trusted: all connections allowed

Zones can be assigned in three different ways
* to whole network interface
* to a source network address
* to a service and port

To assign a network interface to a zone, permanently
```firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --change-interface=en01```

##### Source management

Assign a zone to a source network address. 

To assign a network (all hosts in the network) to a zone, permanently
```firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=192.168.1.0/24```

##### Service and port management

Assign a zone to system service (http, dhcp, ftp, dns, mysql etc.)

```firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=home --add-service=dhcp```

Assign a zone to a listening port

```firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=home --add-port=21/tcp```
